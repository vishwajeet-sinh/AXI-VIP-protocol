What are narrow transfers?
Using above diagram explain (3 master, 4 slaves and an interconnect)
difference between Normal, Exclusive and Locked transfers
difference between Out-of-order, interleaved, overlapping transactions.
difference between cacheble, bufferable transactions
difference between burst transaction and single transaction
difference between normal, privileged and secure transactions
AXI interconnect with 3 masters connected and two of them doing transfers with same ID to the same slave, how interconnect makes sure that response from the slave is routed to correct master?
For below requirement, draw timing diagram
AWADDR = 16’h1000, AWLEN=5, AWSIZE=2, AWBURST=INCR
AWADDR = 16’h1000, AWLEN=5, AWSIZE=2, AWBURST=WRAP
AWADDR = 16’h1003, AWLEN=5, AWSIZE=2, AWBURST=WRAP
AWADDR = 16’h1007, AWLEN=5, AWSIZE=2, AWBURST=INCR
In above cases, which all locations in memory are accessed.
Explain difference between aligned and unaligned transfers using memory mapping diagram
Explain significance of Strobe in AXI Write channel
What is the need for WSTRB, when master does the automatic data alignment?
Explain why we need wlast and rlast when burst len is already indicating number of transfers
Explain 5 different channels in AXI
What is the significance of ID in each channel, how it helps with out-of-order, overlapping, interleaved transfers?
Explain Out of order transactions using a timing diagram.
Explain Overlapping transactions using a timing diagram.
Explain Interleaved transactions using a timing diagram.
Explain difference between SLVERR and DECERR response
List down various features AXI protocol supports
Burst
Out of order, overlapping, interleaved
Explain big endian and little-endian transactions with an example
What are cacheable transactions?
What are bufferable transactions?
How cacheable and bufferable transactions make AXI protocol efficient

->Difficult Questions:

1. Explain AXI Dead lock
2. How AXI interconnect handles multiple master performing writes to same slave using AWID
3. How to it ensure that response is routed to the correct master
4. During read transaction, if AXI Slave issues error response for a transaction, does it require to stop the transaction immediately?
